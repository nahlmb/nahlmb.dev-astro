				<p class="mt-2 mb-6">The world of digital product development is a wide and a unique world for me, at
					this time its development is really fast, and from here we also see that a developer and product
					creator is able to bring and produce works that are really beneficial to many people even in large
					and huge scale.
					Helping is a noble thing and Allah provides a big reward for that, therefore that should be the goal
					of developers.
					So let's work together, let's design products that provide solutions to problems!. <br>~<br>
					This personal site is intended to record my portfolio, on the other hand, I hope to share
					experiences.
					As for all the goodness that I got so that I can spread it here, it is 100% a blessing from the Most
					Merciful, may the Most Merciful give us help always to be able to work and share and achieve
					victory.

							I'm a programmer since 2018, I tried different kinds of technologies, but what I love and
							work
							on the most is Flutter app development and Web development with JAMSTACK, I think those two
							technologies are really productive and efficient technologies. Programming is a vast world,
							it
							must be learned from the basics, so basic then Insyaallah we can make various types of
							extraordinary beneficial works! </p>

								Products are what we present to be a solution to people's needs that must be met, including
								us!,
								and products that use technology well will be very effective and good, and that's what I
								like
								about digital product development, this world requires us to think about presenting
								solutions
								and validate it, develop it and present it and grow the solution. </p>

							We like things that look beautiful, neat and good and that's why design is so important.
							Talking
							about design, actually the meaning can be broad, but what I mean here is how we design and
							present something neatly and beautifully, therefore design is still closely related to
							programming and digital products, one of the important things to learn. </p>
