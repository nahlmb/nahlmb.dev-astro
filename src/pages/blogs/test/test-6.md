## Quran Tool
Quran is one of the most feature that we hope can provide with well in this package. This feature is still under development, there is minor in the code but it works!

This tool provide Quran both in page mode and list mode.
And the cool part Quran Tool provide instant Quran render widget, we will show the detail of it bellow insyaallah.

### Requirement
Quran Tool is using static Quran data, you need to downloaded the data first, put it into assets/quran directory, register the asset path into pubspec.yaml the you'll be able to use the tool insyaallah.

1. You can downloadthe data hare, the extract it : [this link](/zip/quran.zip)
2. Put quran directory on ./assets folder of your project
3. register the asset in pubspec.yaml, as below
```yaml
assets:
  - assets/quran/
```

then the tool is ready to use insyaallah.

### Usage
The easy wasy to show Quran to your app user is using [QuranPageReader].
as easy as bellow instruction.

1. return the Quran page in your page/widget.
```dart
class QuranPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const QuranPage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return QuranPageReader(
      config: QuranPageReaderConfig(),
    );
  }
}
```

if there is no mistake, Quran data will be processed and showed to user üëç

2) via parameter you can set the intial Quran page that want to be showed, you even able put appbar on your [QuranPageReader] or listen when user change the Quran Page.
3) And with [QuranPageReaderConfig] you able to set colors and theming for your [QuranPageReader], also to choose is using page mode or list mode, and to show bottom page indicator or not.

then, how to show list of surah and juzs?
Quran Tool will provide the data for you.

QuranTool quranTool = QuranTool.init();
```
2. get the data
```dart

```

you even able to get whole Quran data, if you want to manually process it without [QuranPageReader].
```dart
List<QuranPage> pages = await quranTool.getQuranPages();
```

## Book Tool 
Book tool actually is tool for showing adzkar and du'a, we named it book because we imagining a collection of du'as or dzikr as a book that contain list of prayer and book, not only that, in the future we also hope to present hadith books.

Same with Quran Tool, you need to download the Book data first, as this following.

### Requirement
1. You can download the data hare, the extract it : [this link](/zip/books.zip)
2. Put quran directory on ./assets folder of your project
3. register the asset in pubspec.yaml, as below
```yaml

```

### Usage
1. Init the tool
```dart
BookTool bookTool = BookTool.init();
```
2. Get the data
```dart
List<Book> duaBook = await bookTool.getDuaBook();
List<Book> dzikrBook = await bookTool.getDzikrBook();
```
3. Show doa and dzikr to your user, you can use ListView to render every item.
4. You can process book detail by your own, or easily with [DzikrReader] as use it as following
```dart
class DzikrDetailPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const DzikrDetailPage({Key? key, required this.book}) : super(key: key);

  final Book book;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBarWidget.getAppBar(context, title: book.title!),
      body: DzikrReader(book: book),
    );
  }
}
```
